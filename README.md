## Planning, Process, and Execution
  We started with designing wireframes and ERD.
  Meet in the morning and do a standup everyday. Prioritize and assign tasks.
  Two people worked on front-end and two on back-end.
  Took turns and swtiched groups to make sure all 4 work on both front and back end.
  Write User Stories for the MVP.
  Test with curl-scripts for each user story.
  Build front-end and test crud operations.
  Add styling to the front-end.
  Deploy to GitHub and Heroku.

## Problem solving strategy
  Our problem solving strategy was that if any one team member was stuck on one problem for
  more than an hour we would all come together as a group to brainstorm possible solutions.
  We found that having fresh eyes on a problem would often lead to new insights and ideas
  that made solving it much easier.

## Reach Goals & Unsolved Problems
  - Let user create a survey with more than two options
  - Make a real-time dashboard
  - Make custom page routes so users can share links to their surveys
